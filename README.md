I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
  title
  url link
  description
  rating (1-5)

I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
  All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

I can click on a bookmark (Expand button) to display the "detailed" view
  Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

I can remove bookmarks (Delete button) from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark (error red box on top right)

I can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection (NOTE: If bookmark doesn't have a rating, it still shows (API doesn't require a rating when POSTing). Used Postman to explore this idea.)

(Extension) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list (Edit button, goes away when not expanded)
